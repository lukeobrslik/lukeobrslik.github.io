Hello everyone!

Let me introduce myself first. My name is Lukas and I have decided to document some of the interesting technologies I get in touch.
It's probably not going to be focused on single area but rather I will pick different topics I find interesting. Those will be related to:
- Telco
- Cloud
- 5G
- Linux
- Azure
